# Marketing Analytics
This project involved a performance analysis of marketing campaigns for an online retail store. My objective was to identify the root causes of decreased customer engagement and conversion rates, and recommend improvements to the existing marketing strategies.

1. The process involved the following steps:

2. Data Preparation & Transformation:  cleaned and  transformed the raw marketing data for analysis. 

3. Customer Sentiment Analysis:  conducted  sentiment analysis on customer reviews to understand customer opinions about products and services. This provided crucial insights for improving engagement and conversions.

4. Data Visualization & Reporting: I imported the prepared data into Power BI to create dynamic dashboards and visualizations. This allowed for the creation of key reports, including conversion rates, engagement metrics (views, clicks, likes), and customer feedback distribution.

5. Strategic Recommendations: The project culminated in a presentation of data-driven recommendations aimed at increasing conversion rates, enhancing customer engagement, and improving customer feedback scores.
